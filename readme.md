# Redis & LocalStack Integration Test Harness

This repository contains a fully containerized integration test setup using **Redis**, **LocalStack (S3)**, and a **test consumer**. 

# Purpose

The purpose of this work was to investigate generating a code base entirely using AI (Chat GPT in this case) Without writing a line of code myself.  Everything was generated and iterated on via ChatGPT.

As well as code, readme's were also autogenerated

## Components

1. **Redis**  
   - Holds a queue of messages to be processed.
2. **LocalStack (S3)**  
   - Provides a mock S3 service for testing file uploads.
3. **Test Consumer**  
   - Pops messages from Redis.
   - Uploads a file with the message content to S3.
4. **Test Harness**  
   - Pushes messages to Redis.
   - Waits for messages to be consumed.
   - Verifies the corresponding file exists in S3.

## Requirements

- Docker or Podman
- Docker Compose or Podman Compose

> No need to install Redis or AWS CLI on your host machine â€” everything runs inside containers.

## Build & Run

### 1. Build the Docker images


```bash
# Build Test Harness
cd testHarness
docker build -t test-harness .

# Build system under test
cd systemUnderTest
docker build -t test-consumer .

```

### 2. Run 

```bash
# Run infrastructure
docker-compose up -d redis localstack redisinsight

# Run the system under test (test consumer)
docker-compose up test-consumer

# Run the test harness 
docker-compose up test-harness
```
